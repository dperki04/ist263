        My name is David. I am an ADA major at Syracuse University with a minor in Computer Science. I am graduating in Spring 2026. I am heavily interested in mobile development as well as data analytics. My hobbies include fishing, kayaking, hiking, reading, and running. I am an outdoorsman, and I love being outside.
